            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               My name is Beni Minyeri, I am 19 years old and currently attend school at <em>Algonquin College</em>
               as a 1<sup>st</sup> year student.
               I love being active mentally and physically.
                I used to play three sports back to back to keep me going through mt studies.
                 That is why I decided to take Interactive Media Design where i can still be creative, 
                 although I do not play sports professionally anymore
            </p>

            <p>
               I grew up loving to create and inspire others through my work plus action.
               Having my fashion line that not only shows my creativity, but also inspires
               the old, young, and generations to come is my main objective.
               <blockquote>As humans, we are all special in our own ways that is why I believe that we 
               are all born to create and bring nothing to something. -<cite>Beni Minyeri</cite></blockquote>
